  'Inspired by the Abstract Limited Edition that was introduced in 2018, the guitar was developed in response to the growing demand for a follow-up model. New design elements were developed using combinations of triangular shapes that form geometrical designs on the headstock and fretboard position markers.',
  'Guitar is designed to be a very accessible acoustic guitar which is based on the popular Grand Auditorium body shape that boasts a full yet balanced sound. Great for everyday usage, and thanks to its integrated preamp system, the guitar is also suitable for live performances.',
  'If you’re ready to rock but want a guitar that’s as easy on your budget as it is powerful in the studio and on stage, the guitar is a great choice. Built with set-neck construction at 24.75” scale, the guitar has a mahogany body and comfortable three-piece maple neck that features a roasted jatoba fingerboard with 24 extra-jumbo frets and dot inlays.',
  'Guitars are designed to offer the tone, feel, looks, and quality that working professional musicians need in an instrument. The guitar is a seven-string guitar that offers high-end playability along with the extended range of an additional string to broaden your tonal horizons.

The guitar has high-quality components like a Graphtech Nubone XB nut and saddle, Grover tuners, a Fishman S-Core pickup, and Fishman TL-3 preamp with onboard tuner.'
